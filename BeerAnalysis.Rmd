# Introduction
According to a recent [article in Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/garystoller/2018/03/20/craft-breweries-dominate-the-top-50-but-guess-which-giants-rule-the-beer-market/#3b6528dedcad), MillerCoors _(which owns Blue Moon, Pilsener Urquell and numerous brands besides Miller and Coors products)_, ranks No. 2 in volume of beer produced for sale. Constellation Brands is No. 3 with its various brands, including Corona and Modelo. 

The traditional giants have bought some craft breweries in recent years, blurring the lines between craft and non-craft brewing companies. Anheuser-Busch bought 10 Barrel Brewing of Bend, Oregon, and Constellation Brands purchased Sand Diego-based Ballast Point for $1 billion.

This signifies that Craft beers have grown in popularity since the early 2000's and have skyrocketed in 2010 (see Figure 1 below).

In the US alone there are well over 150 styles of beer with as many breweries in each state. Knowing the [palate](https://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2014/09/7-ways-to-be-a-better-beer-taster.html) of potential customers can gain your brewery an edge in profit margins by staying close their preferences. Even more important is that the various regions in the USA might actually have variying taste / alcohol content preferences from other regions.

[Brewer's Association of America](https://www.brewersassociation.org), has supplied data and various questions to __JVKRDSLD and Associates__ to conduct a study for would-be investors to better understand the chances of product success in today's hyper-competative market.

```{r LoadLibraries}
#Load necessary libraries for the project.
library(ggplot2)
library(DataExplorer)
library(dplyr)
library(usmap)
```

## Brewery Count and Location
The first question to answer for the BAA is how many breweries are there in the USA and what is their location. The results indicate which states may be over populated with breweries and states that have not seen a wild growth in breweries. This is beneficial in determining which market to target based on saturation.

```{r BreweriesByState, echo=TRUE}
#Read both raw CSV files into R for data tidying and maniupulation
Beers <- read.csv("Beers.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", strip.white = TRUE)
Breweries <- read.csv("Breweries.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", strip.white = TRUE)

#Create State DB data frame
StateDB <- data.frame(state.name, state.abb, state.region)

#Rename columns for readability
colnames(StateDB)[colnames(StateDB)=='state.name'] <- 'StateName'
colnames(StateDB)[colnames(StateDB)=='state.abb'] <- 'State'
colnames(StateDB)[colnames(StateDB)=='state.region'] <- 'StateRegion'

#Add district of Columbia to StateDB Data Frame
DistrictColumbia <- data.frame("District of Columbia","DC", "South")
names(DistrictColumbia) <- c("StateName","State", "StateRegion")
StateDB <- rbind(StateDB, DistrictColumbia)

#Create object to hold the counts of breweries by state
BreweryCounts <- data.frame(table(Breweries$State))

#rename column names
colnames(BreweryCounts)[colnames(BreweryCounts)=='Var1'] <- 'State'
colnames(BreweryCounts)[colnames(BreweryCounts)=='Freq'] <- 'NumberOfBreweriesByState'

#Merge the StateDB and sort by count of breweries by state
BreweryCounts <- merge(BreweryCounts, StateDB, by.x=("State"), by.y=("State"))
BreweryCounts <- BreweryCounts[order(BreweryCounts$NumberOfBreweriesByState, decreasing=TRUE),c(3,2)]
BreweryCounts

#Merge BreweryCounts to the statepop data set by state name
BreweryCountsMap <- merge(statepop, BreweryCounts, by.x=("full"), by.y=("StateName"))

#Plot states and color by brewery counts
usmap::plot_usmap(data = BreweryCountsMap,
                        values = "NumberOfBreweriesByState",
                        lines = "black") + scale_fill_continuous(
                        low = "green",
                        high = "red",
                        name = "Brewery Count",
                        label = scales::comma) + theme(legend.position = "right")+
                        labs(title = "Number of Breweries per State")
```

## Making Sense of the Data
In an effort to understand the relationship between the types of beers sold as well as the breweries that made them, the beer and breweries data sets were merged along side the states database. To check-in on the merged data-set, we will review the first and last 6 rows of the data to get a sense of the type of information we are working with in order to evaluate to our final lists of questions provided by the BAA.

```{r MergeData, echo=TRUE}
#join data on Brewery_id and Brew_ID 
BeersAndBreweries <- merge(Beers, Breweries, by.x=("Brewery_id"), by.y=("Brew_ID"))

#rename the name.x(Beer) and name.y(Brewery) after the merge for consistency
colnames(BeersAndBreweries)[colnames(BeersAndBreweries)=='Name.x'] <- 'BeerName'
colnames(BeersAndBreweries)[colnames(BeersAndBreweries)=='Name.y'] <- 'BreweryName'

#Merge data with State DB
BeersAndBreweries <- merge(BeersAndBreweries, StateDB, by="State", all = TRUE)

# dont think we need to show this.
# #find dimensions of data frames
# dim(BeersAndBreweries)
# dim(BeersAndBreweries)

#Show first and last 6 entries of merged files
head(BeersAndBreweries)
tail(BeersAndBreweries)
```

## Determine Any Missing Values
As with any raw data-sets, checks had to be instituted for missing values. Providing statistical analysis will serve our client best if we understand the missing values to ensure the results are minimally skewed. A report for both a graphical and tabular representation of the results is provided below. The team utilized an example library from [Genetics & Bioinformatics Research](http://www.gettinggeneticsdone.com/2011/02/summarize-missing-data-for-all.html) to count missing values. The data shows the variables with missing data are the IBU and ABV values.

```{r MissingValues, echo=TRUE}
#Graphical representation of missing vaules using 'DataExporer' library
plot_missing(BeersAndBreweries, title = "Percent of Missing Values")

#Function to count all NA's in columns
propmiss <- function(dataframe) {
  m <- sapply(dataframe, function(x) {
    data.frame(
      na_count=sum(is.na(x)),
      Obs=length(x), 
      perc_missing=sum(is.na(x))/length(x)*100
    )
  })
  d <- data.frame(t(m))
  d <- sapply(d, unlist)
  d <- as.data.frame(d)
  d$variable <- row.names(d)
  row.names(d) <- NULL
  d <- cbind(d[ncol(d)],d[-ncol(d)])
  return(d[order(d$na_count, decreasing=TRUE), ])
}

#show results of NA's counted
BeerColumnInventory_nacount <- propmiss(BeersAndBreweries)
BeerColumnInventory_nacount
```

## Visual Display of the Data
To look for trends in the newly described dataset, the team plotted the ABV and IBU against the states to determine which states had the highest median value. *As requested by the client, all of the NA's have been removed*

* Process of obtating the median values
    + Calculate the median values of ABV & IBU by state
    + Plot the data against states and sort by highest value

```{r Plotting, echo=TRUE}
#Make data frame with only State, ABV, IBU
DF_ABV_IBU <- BeersAndBreweries[,c("StateName","ABV","IBU")]

#remove any rows with a NA value using 'complete.cases'
DF_ABV_IBU_noNA <- DF_ABV_IBU[complete.cases(DF_ABV_IBU),]

#Calculate MEDIAN values for ABV&IBU by State
MEDIAN_ABV_IBU_by_State <- aggregate(DF_ABV_IBU_noNA[, 2:3],list(DF_ABV_IBU_noNA$StateName), median)

#Rename column names
colnames(MEDIAN_ABV_IBU_by_State)[colnames(MEDIAN_ABV_IBU_by_State)=='Group.1'] <- 'State'
colnames(MEDIAN_ABV_IBU_by_State)[colnames(MEDIAN_ABV_IBU_by_State)=='ABV'] <- 'Median_ABV'
colnames(MEDIAN_ABV_IBU_by_State)[colnames(MEDIAN_ABV_IBU_by_State)=='IBU'] <- 'Median_IBU'

#plot MEDIAN ABV By State
BarPlot_ABV_byState <- ggplot(data=MEDIAN_ABV_IBU_by_State, 
                              aes(x=reorder(State, Median_ABV), 
                                  y=Median_ABV)) +
                                  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
                                  coord_flip() +
                                  labs(x="State",
                                       y="Median ABV",
                                       title = "Median Alchol Content by State")
BarPlot_ABV_byState

#Plot MEDIAN IBU By State
BarPlot_IBU_byState <- ggplot(data=MEDIAN_ABV_IBU_by_State, 
                              aes(x=reorder(State, Median_IBU), 
                                  y=Median_IBU)) +
                              geom_bar(stat="identity")+
                              coord_flip()+
                              labs(x="State",
                                   y="Median_IBU",
                                   title = "Median Bitterness Content by State")
BarPlot_IBU_byState

```

## States with highest ABV and IBU
Beer has a few indicators that help us understand a bit more about the beer without having to sample each and every beer for comparison. People naturally have different tastes and preferences for the types of beer they enjoy. Alcohol by Volume (ABV) and International Bittnerness Units (IBU) are some of the most common variables we use to identify the personality of the beer without have to necessarily taste it. A good start is to look at the state that has the highest ABV and IBU respectively. We can deduce the preference of the location based on those factors.

```{r MaxValues, echo=TRUE}
#Find MAX ABV with State
MAX_ABV_byState <- head(BeersAndBreweries[order(BeersAndBreweries$ABV, na.last = TRUE, decreasing=TRUE),c(11,5)],1)
MAX_ABV_byState

#Find MAX IBU with State, column has missing values
MAX_IBU_byState <- head(BeersAndBreweries[order(BeersAndBreweries$IBU, na.last = TRUE, decreasing=TRUE),c(11,6)],1)
MAX_IBU_byState
```

## Summary of ABV
As requested, the client prferred to see summary statistics of the summary variable of ABV. 

```{r SummaryABV, echo=TRUE}
#Summary Stats of the ABV variable
SUMMARY_ABV <- summary(BeersAndBreweries$ABV)

#Show ABV SUmmary
SUMMARY_ABV
```

## Relationship between ABV & IBU
To sum up the request, a scatter plot of the data by region will help the organization determine the relationship between the ABV and IBU. We have color coded the regions as well to help identify the relationship overall as well as by region. It appears that the more ABV we have the more IBU can be expected. We can also deduce a preference by most people to have minimal IBU and ABV. 

```{r Relationships, echo=TRUE}
#Merge data with State DB
DF_ABV_IBU_noNA <- merge(DF_ABV_IBU_noNA, StateDB, by="StateName", all = TRUE)

#Remove rows with NA's
DF_ABV_IBU_noNA <- DF_ABV_IBU_noNA[complete.cases(DF_ABV_IBU_noNA),]

# I don't think we need to show this.
#Check merge and top of the file
# propmiss(DF_ABV_IBU_noNA)
# head(DF_ABV_IBU_noNA)

#Scatter plot ABV vs IBU and color by StateRegion
ABUvsIBU <- qplot(ABV, IBU, 
                  xlab = "ABV (Alcohol Content)",
                  ylab = "IBU (Bitterness)",
                  main= "ABV vs IBU", 
                  colour=StateRegion,
                  data=DF_ABV_IBU_noNA)

#Show Scatter Plot
ABUvsIBU
